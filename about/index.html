title: CREDIT DESIGN ABOUT
---

<p>Hi! Iâ€™m Chris Ryan. I'm interested in front end design and development, interactive graphics (SVG and canvas via D3.js and THREE.js), animation (traditional, after effects and 3D), programming (javascript and maybe a little ObjectiveC and Rails), 3D graphics applications (Cinema4D, Blender, Maya) and music composition and production (I play a little guitar).</p> 

<p>I'm attempting to learn about all of these things and I'll blog about my progress here. Come along for the ride, or watch me crash and burn.</p>

<p>You can also find me on  <a href="https://twitter.com/creditdesign" target="_blank">twitter</a>, <a href="https://github.com/chris-creditdesign" target="_blank">github</a>, <a href="http://creditdesign.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">tumblr</a> and <a href="http://codepen.io/chris-creditdesign" target="_blank">codepen</a>.</p>
