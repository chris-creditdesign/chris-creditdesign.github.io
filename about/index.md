### Who am I?

Hi! Iâ€™m Chris Ryan. I like drawing robots and making things move on the internet.

I work for [@NatureNews](https://twitter.com/NatureNews) in London making interactive graphics and animations.

You can also find me on  [twitter](https://twitter.com/creditdesign), [github](https://github.com/chris-creditdesign), [tumblr](http://creditdesign.tumblr.com) and [codepen](http://codepen.io/chris-creditdesign).

### How did I make this website?

This website is built with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and hosted by [github pages](https://pages.github.com/). Check out the source code [here](https://github.com/chris-creditdesign/chris-creditdesign.github.io).
