## What's the catch?

Ok so for so similar. The big difference is that web pages are created by writing code rather than dragging boxes around the screen and choosing fonts from dropdown menus. But that's nothing to be scared of. With a little practice writing code becomes both fun and easy and allows you to work a lot faster than you could dragging boxes around getting RSI.

## Talking to computers

'Computer code' comes in many shapes and sizes but it's all basically be designed to do the same thing. Contain information or instructions that humans can read and write that can also be understood by computers. Sounds simple right?

Unfortunately computers are stupid and have a hard time understanding what we are going on about. In the future we may simply be able to speak instructions at a floating computer orb that will interpret and act our our intentions instantly. Right now we have to meet them hard way.

If we write an email to a friend we can put in spelling mistakes, bad grammar or use slang words and our friend will generally get what we're going on about. Unfortunately this doesn't work with computers - they don't do slang.

### The Queens English

There are many different computer programming languages and they each have their own syntax. This agreed upon set of rules that must be adhered to in order for the computer to understand what you are saying. Imagine you are speaking to the Queen. You have to use the Queen's English or she'll order the guards to cut off your head. Luckily a computer won't cut off your head, but they will refuse to work if you don't talk to them in the manner that they are accustomed to.

### Three headed beast

Thankfully there are only three core languages that you need to be familiar with to produce websites.

Those are HTML, CSS and Javascript.

### Quick history of the internet History of the internet

Let's take a quick break and explore a quick potted history of the internet.

I'm going to throw lots of acronyms at you, as is the way with the internet, but in most instances you can just forget what they stand for or correct me when I get them wrong.

The internet as we know it was created by a gentleman called Tim Berners Lee back in the 80s.

At that time there were already networks of computers that could communicate around the world - but it was really a pain in the arse. There was ftp (file transfer protocol) which is still in use today as well as basic email and message boards.

What he invented was a way to store documents on a central computer which can then be accessed by other computers and viewed in a new sort of program called a browser. Something that we're all very familiar with now.

The spark of genius was in allowing those documents to link to each other. 

This system went on to become one of the most successful and pervasive communication mediums ever invented. 

It's funny that it was originally invented as a way for physicists to share scientific papers - so it's especially apt that we're sitting in Nature today.

This is a screen shot of Tim's first browser, named WorldWideWeb and later renamed as Nexus. As you can see it doesn't look a million miles away from web browsers we use today.

On of the cornerstones of his new system was HTML - which is still the foundation of all websites today.

## HTML

HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language.

Hypertext is just regular text but with 'hyperlinks' or links added. Markup refers to marking up that text, or diving it into sections with markers to say which bit is which ie this is the headline, this is a paragraph, this is a list or whatever.

Language is just language.

You can open a simple text editor like notepad and write some html to create a perfectly functional website. You can import images and add links and then share it with anyone in the world instantly. It just won't be very exciting to look at.

### View source

Has everyone here viewed the source of a webpage before? Let's do it!

Right click and select 'View page source'.

What you're looking at here is all the code that goes into building this simple nature article.

This is actually a bit more complicated than it needs to be. As we scroll down we can see chunks of code that are used for the page navigation, the twitter links etc... but with a bit of searching we can find the content we were expecting to find. The headline and the first paragraph. 

## CSS

In the years that followed some more tools were invented to make websites more engaging. The next major development came around 1996 when a gentleman in Sweden, working on what would become the Opera browser invented something called CSS.

CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets and is responsible for bringing visual style to our websites.

These style sheets work in exactly the same as the style sheets we are used to in indesign but they are even more powerful. Because HTML on its doesn't give us the ability to position elements on the page the way that we can with indesign boxes that funcitonality is provided by CSS. On top of that CSS can be used to create special effects like animations, interactions and even moving page objects in a 3D space.

The word cascading refers to the fact that styles can cascade or fall down from one to another.

# Codepen demo

For instance say we use CSS to set all of our links to be in Helvetica and to be blue.

We can then write another rule to set all of our visited links, that is links that the browser remembers that we have clicked on before, to be green.

These links will be green and in set in helvetica.

The choice of helvetica has litterally cascaded down to the visited links. This is the basis of CSS and we'll be diving it into more detail in later on.

## JAVASCRIPT

Around the same time JavaScript was developed as a programming language to run inside web browsers and add interactivity to webpages. Unusually for something that lives on the internet javascript is not actually an acronym - it's just a silly word. 

<!-- There's a running theme of programming languages being name after types of coffee. I have no idea why. At the time a of Java scripts release a programming language called Java was big business. A script is considered to be lightweight programme. So the name JavaScript was chosen to give the impression that  -->

JavaScript was originally put to use doing annoying things like popup windows and alert boxes but as the processing power of our computers and the sophistication of or internet browsers has increased JavaScript has matured into a fully featured programming language that powers all sorts of engaging experiences on the web.

var date = new Date();
document.write(date);

alert(date);

## You can break the rules 

## But you shouldn't 

### At least learn the rules first...

Most of what I'm going to show you can be considered best practices/guidelines. With regards to website we normally say 'standards'. You can break the rules and the world probably won't end. Just like you can break the rules in print design. You CAN send a magazine to print with low resolution images or RGB colour and maybe the local printing press will call you up ask if you really want to print this magazine because the images look fuzzy and the colours look like crap and if you still give the go ahead the printers will do their best job at printing your magazine and making it look good - but the results will be upredictable at best and completely useless at best. The same is true on the web, you can send publish a file that is completely non standard all full of errors and the web browsers of the world will do their best to interpret your file and turn it into something useful for your readers but again the results will be unpredictable at best and completely useless most of the time. The main difference being the browsers won't call you up to discuss your crappy file.

Different browsers are like different presses around the world
